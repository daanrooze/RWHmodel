### statistics setup ###
#	threshold: The number of timesteps that the reservoir cannot supply the required demand.
#	T_return_list: List of return periods that will be used in the analysis.
#   srf_area: Surface area [m2].
#	int_cap: Maximum interception storage capacity of surface [mm].

threshold = 3
T_return_list = [1,2,5,10,20,50,100]
srf_area = 100
int_cap = 2


### seasonal variation parameters ###
#   shift: the phase of the sinus curves
#   perc_constant: the percentage of the yearly water demand that is contantly used across the year (i.e. everything but garden irrigation, which is higher in the summer)
#   The defaults given below are ones for the Euopean climate, with a higher water demand in the summer
 
shift = 4.639
perc_constant = 0.96
