### seasonal variation parameters ###
#   shift: the phase of the sinus curves
#   perc_constant: the percentage of the yearly water demand that is contantly used across the year (i.e. everything but garden irrigation, which is higher in the summer)
#   The defaults given below are ones for the Euopean climate, with a higher water demand in the summer
